## Overview

This project is designed to demonstrate variations in UI components using React and Tailwind CSS. The focus is on creating a visually appealing and user-friendly experience that makes a strong first impression. The application showcases two distinct design versions for various UI elements, including menus, grid views, tile views, and expanded views.

## Features

2. **Horizontal Menu:** A top-aligned menu bar with sample items.
3. **Grid View:** A grid display of student data, organized in a clean and structured manner.

## API Integration

- The application fetches data from the [JSONPlaceholder API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users) to display in the grid and tile viewsws, demonstrating dynamic content handling.

## Conclusion

This application is designed to showcase the flexibility and visual impact of modern UI design. The dual versions of each component offer a clear comparison, allowing stakeholders to make informed decisions about the design direction for larger projects.
